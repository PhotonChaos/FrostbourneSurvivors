# Frostbourne Survivors
A game about surviving in the Frostbourne Wilds. This is from the Remagica TTRPG by ClariseTG.

## Plan
- Make XP orbs actually a mana-like ammo system for stronger attacks?
- If excess mana is collected, turn into actual xp? Maybe add leveling just for stats
- Items for passive buffs
- Player chooses spell loadout to begin with, spells cost mana but are stronger
- X cost spell, hold attack down to charge it with mana then fire
